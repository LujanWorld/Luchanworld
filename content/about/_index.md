Hello everyone! I am Lujan, and i has been travel around the world for more the 3 years, i start alone my very first big Trip from Buenos Aires to Costa Rica, and i fall in love with the people, the nature, with the Pura Vida culture; but I was always very curious and i wanted to see what was beyond, on the other side of the world.

## Crossing the puddle

I was again in another adventure in Barcelona Spain, and in this experience i start to think, Why do not I travel around the world?
Fortunately I found on the trip the best partener in the world, M. So we continue our trip to  Italy, at the romantic Venice, then in the glorious Rome.
And then we decide to cross the border to Croatia, and we spent 2 beautiful weeks in a small town in the middle of the mountain.

## The best is coming!

Later we decided that we needed a bit of city and flew to Sofia Bulgaria. A very economic city, with many vegetarian offers and art everywhere.

Then in Thailand  we were 3 months  for Bangkok and a beautiful island Kho Chang. After Thailand we went to Malaysia for some Windsurfind, and them we decide to celebrated Christmas in Latvia, with M. family's. 
Was amazing experiance for me, fisrt time he introduce me his family, and also celebrated Christmas with snow. (In Argentina we celebrate christmas in summer, around 30-35 deggres).
It was incredible to be in the opposite pole and feel the same in family and happy.

# Christmas time

We dined in a house on the beach with some friends of the family, and between songs and delicious dishes, we received the Christmas presents, but first each one had to offer something in exchange for the gifts. Then it occurred to me to offer a tango class with the basic steps for all the guests. And that's how we celebrated Christmas by dancing tangos with locals.
The spirit of cutting the tree and placing it in the room, walking through the snow-covered streets, its Christmas meals and a big fireworks and music show surprised me in the center of Riga. Steamy mugs of aromatic mulled wine but have you ever tried hot blackcurrant juice with a dash of Riga Black Balsam? The popular Latvian spirit is claimed to have healing properties. As a cocktail, the juice and balsam is a warming, sweet and sticky seasonal hit.
Enjoy an evening at Riga’s Christmas markets with a mug of juice and balsam and other gourmet delights, like wild boar sausages and homemade gingerbread.

## Chill out

### Sauna

The mom has a ritual with her friends, and every Monday they come together to enjoy a relaxed afternoon in the sauna.
 The ritual is designed to cleanse both physically and mentally. It involves tea, temperature changes, natural scrubs and massages.
A real sauna experience can take up to three or four hours. It’s a blissful experience for couples, families or close groups of friends.

### Opera

The National Opera of Latvia is located in a privileged place of Riga, next to one of the main canals of the capital and next to the old part of the city and surrounded by gardens where you can enjoy a walk or a stop in your visit to the Latvian capital. Throughout the year its agenda is full of events. It is an impressive building.

### Beach

Jurmala is the largest spa town in the Baltic. The attractiveness of Jurmala, which is located a few minutes away from Riga, resides on its 33 kilometers of white sandy beaches, large pine forests and the natural border of the city, the Lielupe River, as well as a combination of charming wood built at the beginning of the last century and more modern buildings.

After these wonderful moments we decided to travel and share our lives together. I do not now in what part of the world will we find our next experiences?
