Woooo always the first time are unforgettable. Me and myself arriving in Barcelona, not knowing how to get to the house of a friend who was going to host me for a few days, It was pretty scary, but after several train stations, I did it. The means of public transport work very well, and the price is accessible. You can take the train from the airport to your next destination in Barcelona. Also you can buy a transport voucher to enjoy Barcelona in 3 days, it is called "Hola Barcelona" and you have unlimited transport (metro, bus, suburban) for 2.3 or 4 days.

I will always be very grateful to her and her family, I felt at home and managed to spend some wonderful days in the  beautiful Barcelona.
My favorite place is Barceloneta, a fishermen's neighborhood, which  recommend me a Catalan friend in Costa Rica. A good option to tour the city is The Barcelona Card includes free admission to many museums and monuments. The most tourist attractions are not included in the Barcelona Card, but we will have discounts on them.

The Sacred Family is a striking building on the outside, but inside it is a beauty. at lunchtime there are fewer waiting lines. Light, colors, height ... In the lower part Gaudí is buried. The day he died, the whole town accompanied him to his Sacred Family.


Plaza Cataluña, the nerve center of the city. From here, in addition, free tours through the center. At its southern end begins the most famous street in Barcelona, La Rambla. We advise you to take it easy because you will have to share your way with a few more tourists, but it will be worth it. As you go down, you will attend the improvised shows of the street artists and you will pass through emblematic places such as the Canaletas fountain (where the Barça titles are held), the Liceu theater or the La Boquería market.

The Borne. In addition to its small squares and churches such as Santa María del Mar, the Picasso Museum or the incredible Palacio de la Música, El Borne is famous for its trendy venues where you can dine on tapas and have a cocktail afterwards. Search in the area of Paseo del Borne or in the vicinity of Santa Caterina Market. A good option is the Mosquito (Asian tapas), the Bormuth (typical tapas and good vermouth) or Pim Pam Burger (one of the best burgers in Barcelona).

This old building has been able to adapt to the times and combines its local and traditional atmosphere with more current elements. If you are a lover of local markets, perhaps this is not the most authentic you have seen, but it is undoubtedly the most famous in the city.

# The trust in providence

My next destination was Palma de Mallorca, where I was inspired by love, and there I found myself living in the house of a family of Argentine-Brazilian descent, where I spend almost 3 months, traveling the island, its mountains, its wonderful beaches with coves, and deeply loving the Mediterranean its colors and its beings.

I've loved La Ensaimada, which is a typically Mallorcan cake and has become a symbol of the island.

Very close to the cathedral and the historic center, there is the Paseo Marítimo of the city or Avenida de Gabriel Roca. This beautiful promenade is one of the nerve centers of Palma de Mallorca. Running, walking or cycling, or eating and having a drink in one of its number restaurants, bars or clubs is one of the most important things to do in Palma de Mallorca.

My favourite place was Portilxol, I was doing some acroyoga sessions for kids and it was really fun. 
Cala Mayor,  is a very quiet beach and a good place to snorkel, enjoy its caves and why not climb a little.

Formentor Beach, Located a few kilometers from the Port of Pollença, Playa de Formentor is considered one of the best beaches in Mallorca.
Cala Varques es una cala virgen preciosa, de las mejores calas de Mallorca, situada a medio camino entre las urbanizaciones de Cales de Mallorca y Cala Romántica, Manacor. This cove can boast of having the largest cave network in Europe.

## La belle Itali

Then I decided to travel through Italy, with a person I had met in Costa Rica, who later turned out to be the love of my life, I will tell you in more detail, as it happened.
We traveled through the glorious Rome, I liked very much to get lost in its little streets, eat and drink its delights, of course, away from the surcharge of the urban center.
The romantic Venice, where I had to climb through the window of our house to be able to enter. 

### Peace in the mountains of Croatia

Then we  decided to go north to the city of Trieste, where we received the carnival in its streets, with lots of party. and through that border we cross to Croatia.
There we spent a month in a house on the mountain, made of stone, and with very few neighbors. the nearest store was 3 km away. There we found homemade wine and very warm people.  was a nice experience to be in peace and tranquility.

#### Sofia 

After that, we were in Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria that surprised us all the art and cultural activities in its streets. And by the way the food is very good and cheap. Knowing the character of its people, discovering its markets, its gastronomy, its parks are some of the things that you can do in Sofia, besides, it is a great unknown, little visited and it gives you the advantage of walking through its streets without tourists' burdens , a luxury that any city in the world can not afford.

The architecture of the different towns that dominated Sofia is an example of the millenary history of the city, with buildings of Ottoman style, Russian orthodox or of its socialist period.
