Thailand was formerly the kingdom of Siam. In 1939 it was renamed Prathet Thai (ประเทศไทย) which means "free country" or land of the Thai (Thailand and therefore Thailand)
Its capital is Bangkok and the official language is Thai. It has 65 million inhabitants
It is a constitutional monarchy, the king is Bhumibol Adulyadej (Rama IX, born in the United States) and Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva (born in the United Kingdom). The king has been on the throne since 1949 and is the head of state who has held the longest position in the world
About 95% of Thais are Buddhists of the Theravāda tradition but there are also minorities of Muslims, Christians and Hindus. Islam prevails in the southern provinces of the country

## It depends on the glass with which you look at it

Thailand is the second strongest economy in Southeast Asia after Indonesia. It depends mainly on its exports of rice and tourism
Honor is a very important concept in Thai culture, that's why you never see them arguing or shouting in public
The greeting or reverence they perform by joining hands is called wai
It is impolite to touch a person's head or point to something or someone with their feet. It is an insult to step on the food or pass over a person who is sitting or lying on the floor. Nor is it well seen to put your feet on the chair, these should always be on the floor. Do not point your feet towards the Buddha image and you always have to take off your shoes when entering a house or temple
Thai cuisine mixes five flavors: sweet, spicy, sour, bitter and salty. The basic food is rice, which is in almost all meals. And it's so but so rich that I'm afraid to go rolling again!
 

It is illegal to step on bills or coins as they have the image of the king
Thailand is a very open and tolerant country with respect to homosexuality. Bangkok is one of the most gay friendly cities in the world, but on the other hand gays can not study to be teachers or join the army
The food is eaten with sticks or with a fork and a spoon: the spoon is used as a fork and the fork as a knife (or to push the food on the spoon). Thai people find it very strange that someone uses a fork to take food to their mouths (I was doing all these days!). When you finish eating, put the fork on top of the spoon, in the middle of the plate
The cars have the steering wheel on the right side and it is driven on the left (first time I see this in real life)
The national anthem is passed twice a day in public places, on trains and subways. The Thais stop what they are doing and stay until the anthem ends. Out of respect, foreigners must do the same (not like me I realized several seconds after the whole park was frozen listening to the anthem)

### Animals

Thai dogs can have life insurance: there is a company that offers compensation in case of death of the pet. If the dog is of foreign origin with a pedigree, the insurance covers up to 500,000 baht (about 20,000 dollars), if it is local breed, for about 500 dollars
Many motorcyclists ride without a helmet but with a chinstrap (why, I did not discover it yet)
In the villages, when the Thais wake up, it is very common to go out to sweep the sidewalks or the beaches
For now I did not find any street that follows a straight line by many meters, in general form S or other letters like that ... I always take a long time to reach places I decide to go, and I have to be very careful if I do not want to take 4hs in finding my hotel when returning from a long day of walking;)
In addition to the Thai alphabet is very complicated to learn by its writing and pronunciation, there is something else: men end their sentences with khráp and women say kha.

#### The food

From what I've seen so far, Thais eat at all times ... Today I went for a walk at 7 in the morning and they were already preparing fried chicken
In Thailand there are more than 5000 (yes, five thousand) 7-Eleven (an American chain that sells food, candy, cookies, pharmacy items ... something like a "mini super" or a large kiosk with a lot of air conditioning
