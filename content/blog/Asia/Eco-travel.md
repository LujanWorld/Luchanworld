## Sustainable Travel

#### Reducing Your Vacation’s Impact Is Easier Than You Think

Pack light: Less luggage means a reduction in carbon emissions released into the atmosphere by your plane. Whilst it might not compensate for the flight itself, it can help!

Protect the environment
Bring a reusable utensil sets, a refillable water bottle and a water filter so you don’t have to waste plastic. Besides, it’s cheaper too.

Minimise single-use plastic altogether: Ditch the single use plastic miniatures by switching to solid shampoo and conditioner, solid soap, bamboo toothbrush, bamboo comb and toothpaste tablets.

Choose the most environmentally friendly form of transport. Can you drive or take the train to your destination instead of flying?
Try to especially avoid short haul (< 500 km) flights, and if you must fly, choose airlines with higher occupancy rates and more efficient aircraft.

Minimize your carbon emissions and pollution: try to book direct flights and keep domestic flights at a minimum

Support the local economy
Stay with locals for an authentic experience - find a homestay or AirBnB

When possible, support family-owned local businesses that employ local people rather than large international companies

Hire a local guide! After all, they know their home country better than anyone

Visit fair-trade plantations such as coffee, tea, or chocolate!

Travel during the off-season: cyclical vacation trends make it difficult for locals to subsist on sporadic incomes. Besides, it’s cheaper and less crowded!.

Visit national parks - your entry fees contribute to preserving nature

Ensure that tour companies have good animal treatment practices - especially if the tour involves interacting with animals

Recycle and reduce. Recycle newspapers, magazines and your beverage containers (many can be returned for refunds), and reduce the number of bags, napkins and disposable cups you use when you eat fast food.
