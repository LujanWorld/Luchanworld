## International yoga day

#### The ultimate global yoga project

The inaugural IYD happened on June 21, 2015, a few months after it was proposed at a United Nations General Assembly by then new prime minister of India, Narendra Modi. It was supported by 177 nations, the highest number for any UNGA resolution, and went through without needing a vote. Most of the world, apparently, loves yoga, and the countries seemed happy to officially celebrate the practice on a designated day. (Notable other official world recognition: in 2016, yoga was added to Unesco’s “intangible world heritage” list.)

When he introduced the event in September 2014, Modi said of the practice: “Yoga is an invaluable gift of India’s ancient tradition. It embodies unity of mind and body; thought and action; restraint and fulfillment; harmony between man and nature; a holistic approach to health and well-being. It is not about exercise but to discover the sense of oneness with yourself, the world and the nature. **By changing our lifestyle and creating consciousness, it can help us deal with climate change**.”

If you’re one of those people who loves yoga and celebrating days, then IYD is perfect for you. You may want to shake up how you participate. Check out what’s happening in your area and commit to attending an event organized by the South Asian community, rather than your local yoga studio. While you’re there, make an effort to talk to people about their practice and life. You could also try a different aspect of the practice – rather than asana, seek out chanting or meditation, or explore a devotional, lineage-based practice.
